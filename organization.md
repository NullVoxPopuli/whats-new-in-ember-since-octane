How EmberJS runs itself is a crucial part of an open source community, and here are the updates

## Deprecation Staging

An addition to the deprecation system to allow ember and other libraries to roll deprecations out more incrementally.
[RFC#649](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/649)

## Improved RFC Process

Allows for more iteration, and migrates away from RFCs being big heavy documents that need to be correct on the first pass. This is fully implemented via a lot of automation, and can be observed on the [RFCs repo](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/)

[Announcement Blog Post](https://blog.emberjs.com/improved-rfc-process/)

## Major releases

[Ember's major release cadence has changed](https://blog.emberjs.com/evolving-embers-major-version-process/): Every 18 months.
Primary goal: make it easier (with reduced risk) for folks to upgrade majors by having fewer deprecations per major.
[Full motivation here](https://blog.emberjs.com/evolving-embers-major-version-process/#toc_why-are-we-doing-this).
Organizations can now schedule when to begin evaluating this work, as it is predictable.
