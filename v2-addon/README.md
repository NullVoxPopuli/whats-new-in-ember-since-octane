# v2 Addons

## New blueprint

New blueprint is [available here](https://github.com/embroider-build/addon-blueprint)

And can be used via `ember addon -b @embroider/addon-blueprint`

NOTE: This blueprint covers a lot of of the common things that need to be wired up for npm packages. V2 addons _are just npm packages_, however configuring npm packages to work correctly requires some nuance to package.json config. 
Best to read up on [package.json#exports](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#exports)
