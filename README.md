# whats-new-in-ember-since-octane

Octane was released in preview in 3.13, and stablily in 3.15 -- this was Dec 20, 2019

All of this will (hopefully ðŸ¤ž ) be part of what makes up the next edition, Polaris

The goal of Polaris is to align with broader ecosystem tooling, make tooling and ember easier to work with, as well as refine the authoring experience of working with Ember so that developers can be more productive. A lot of this work defers to other projects' tooling, such as vite, so that the small ember ecosystem has less to maintain, and can focus on just the framework, and cohesive ember building experience -- all while focusing on bringing everyone along, because we know projects can last a long time, and we want to make the transition as easy as possible.

That said, Polaris is not yet finalized. It's still being defined and explored. _Specifics_ (import paths, etc) around usages of certain tools are subject to change, but there will likely be codemods to help speed up adoption of the change.


Here is an aggregate of features, patterns, etc across the ecosystem (not just ember).

- general development
  - [discouraged and replacement APIs](./replacements.md)
  - [new features](./new-features.md)
- addon authoring
  - [new blueprint & format](./v2-addon/README.md)
  - [build time patterns](./v2-addon/build.md)
- [tooling](./tooling.md)
- [learning](./learning.md)
