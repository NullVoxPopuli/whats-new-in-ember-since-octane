# Tooling

## Glint

Glint is a layer on top of typescript that provides type checking for gjs, gts, and hbs.

Docs, setup, usage are all documented here: https://typed-ember.gitbook.io/glint

## Embroider

Old apps can't just switch to Vite. Embroider provides the stepping stones and intermediary / incremental migration path towards pure Vite usage.

Getting to standalone vite usage will require all your consumed addons to be in the [v2 format](./v2-addon/README.md).
